<h2>Project Walk-through</h2>

<h3>Adding Items to the List</h3>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>The user can write the name of a new item they want to add to the list and click on "add" to add that item. You can see on the second image below that the item has been added to the list.</p>

</p>

<h3>Deleting an item from the list</h3>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kuhy6Hr.png" alt="DeletingItem"></kbd>
</p>

<p>In case the user wants to delete an item for the list, they can simply click on the button "delete" next to the item they want to delete. In this example, I chose to delete the item "wash the dishes".</p>

<h3>Editing an item on the list</h3>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>In case the user wants to edit an item on the list, they can press the button "edit" next to the item they want to edit. In this example I chose to edit the "I need to clean my car" item on the list and change it to "I need to buy toothpaste".</p>

</p>

<p>You can see now that the item has been changed and it is displayed correctly on the list.</p>



<h3>Options Menu</h3>



<p>In the options menu we can change things about the game such as the volume of sound effects, music, and keybinds for how the player moves and interacts with objects in the game.</p>

<h3>Game Over</h3>



<p>When the timer ends, the Game Over screen is shown. On this screen the player can see how many recipes were delivered by the player, and gives the options for the player to click on the "Restart" or "Quit" buttons. "Restart" will play the game from the beginning and "Quit" will simply close the game.</p>

<h3>Picking Up Ingredients</h3>

</p>

<p>In the game the player is required to pick up ingredients from their respective stations and that they can be used in making the recipes be asked for. The player must look at the station and press the interact button (by default the "E" key) to pick up the ingredient of that respective station. In the pictures above we have the player picking up bread and cheese.</p>

<h3>Cutting Tomatoes and Cabbages</h3>

</p>

<p>In the game the player is required to cut ingredients at cutting stations so that they can be used for completing recipes. The player must look at the station and press the interact alternate button (by default the "F" key) until the ingredient is fully cut. In the pictures above we have the player cutting tomatoes and cabbages.</p>

<h3>Cooking Patty</h3>

</p>

</p>

<p>The player has to cook a meat patty in order to make all types of burges. To do that the player gets an uncooked patty from the patty station, and lays it on the stove. By waiting for a bit, the patty gets cooked. If the player waits for too long, the patty will burn and cannot be used on making recipes anymore. A burnt patty is useless, so the player may want to dispose of it by using the trash counter.</p>

<h3>Using Trash</h3>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bxjQ9Zm.png" alt="Level 7"></kbd>
</p>

<p>By holding an item and interacting with trash counter, the player will destroy that item and thus will have their hands free to pick up any other item they desire.</p>

<h3>Delivery Success</h3>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6ws986f.png" alt="Level 7"></kbd>
</p>

<p>By following the recipe correctly and completing one of the dishes in the list, the player can now deliver the recipe. This is where the delivery counter comes in. By interacting with the delivery counter while holding a correct recipe, the player will deliver that dish and increase the amount of recipes delivered by one.</p>

<h3>Delivery Failed</h3>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NFABh4T.png" alt="Level 7"></kbd>
</p>

<p>In case the player delivers an incorrect recipe to the delivery counter, that item will be lost and a message saying the delivery failed will be shown.</p>
